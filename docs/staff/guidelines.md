All staff must follow the guidelines set, failing to do so will result in a warning or your possible removal from the staff team as a whole.

As a staff member, you are here to help out and set an example to other members. This means you must follow all rules shown in <ins>[#rules](https://discord.com/channels/939553319750344744/939553660449480734)</ins> as you are expected to follow them, like any other member.  
If you are breaking the rules, it makes other members think it’s ok to break them too, causing chaos in the server. Which is never good!

Although we expect you to follow the rules all the time, we don’t expect you to be professional all the time. You are allowed to have a laugh and joke around within our staff chats, general and voice chats as long as it is within the rules. We only expect you to be professional when you are helping someone out otherwise they may not think you are taking the issue seriously. We don’t expect you to use perfect grammar and something like “hello how can I help?” works fine when you are helping someone out.

## Staff Rules

Here are some basic rules we expect you to follow as a staff member.
_Not every rule is stated here, use common sense._

1. Don’t give yourself or others roles that are under you.
2. Don’t manually verify anyone. _(Giving someone the member role without them going through Wick verification.)_
3. Don't joke about very controversial/sensitive topics in public chats.
4. Don’t start arguments for no reason, keep it civil.
5. Don’t ever leak confidential information. If you use a message logger, never share deleted messages.
6. Respect the rank hierarchy. Don’t be a “dick” about it though.
7. If **any of the following** occur, you might get removed from the team:
   - A management member determines that your mental health is not in a good state, and you are not able to perform your duties or Sirius is affecting to it.
   - You openly admit that your mental health is heavily deteriorated.
   - Multiple inactivity requests about this topic are created.
8. Punishments should not be given out just because want to. You should have a valid reason for giving out a punishment.
