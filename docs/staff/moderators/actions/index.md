There are different ways to moderate a server, and we expect you do follow our ways when doing so.

## Punishments

Punishments are given to users **AND** support staff members who break the rules. The severity of the punishment depends on the severity of the rule broken.

When issuing a punishment (like warnings, mutes, kicks, bans, etc.), you should **_ALWAYS_** include a reason. This reason should be clear and concise, and should include the rule or description of the rule that was broken.

We prefer if you use Wick's slash commands instead of the prefix commands, as the slash commands provide a "proof" field where you can upload the evidence of the rule being broken (like a screenshot).

If the `DM` option is available, you should always set it to true. This will send the user a DM with the punishment details, including the reason and evidence.

For muting members, always use the `Duration` option to specify the duration of the mute.

:::warning Warning

**_NEVER_** user any other method (Discord's UI, Dyno bot, etc.) to issue punishments. This is to ensure that all punishments are logged in the same place, that all punishments are logged in the same format and that users can appeal their punishment via Wick's appeal system.

## Reports

Reports are a way for users to report inappropriate behavior to the moderation team and are sent in the [#reports](https://discord.com/channels/939553319750344744/1069692428770095214) channel. Reports are handled by moderators and administrators.

A report containts handy information and action buttons. The reported message is always wrapped in spoilers just in case it's something NSFW. You just have to click on it and it will show the reported message.

Review the report carefully and take the appropriate action. If you are unsure of what action to take, you can ping any Moderator+ in the reports channel.

The action buttons are self-explanatory.
