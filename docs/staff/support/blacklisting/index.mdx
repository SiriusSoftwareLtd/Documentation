“Blacklisting” is what we mean when we refer to removing someone's access to our services. Their license, HWID and IP address will be incapable of using any of these. Some offenses may also prohibit the user from purchasing again if they ever decided to. When blacklisting someone, make sure you tell them if they can or can not purchase again. People who get permanently banned from the discord server and have an active license must be blacklisted.

All offenses that are worth a punishment are listed in the TOS channel. People below Moderator need approval from a higher up to issue a blacklist.

## Blacklisting

The following reasons will also prohibit the user from purchasing again:

- Reverse engineering attempts
- Chargebacks
- Repeated violations of the TOS
- Unauthorized payments

### How to blacklist someone:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="step1" label="Step 1" default>
    Run the <code>/blacklist</code> slash command on them.
    <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/staff/blacklistcommand.png")} alt="Blacklist Command" style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="step2" label="Last Step">
    After running the previous command, you will see the following embed.
    <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/staff/blacklistembed.png")} alt="Blacklist Embed" style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
