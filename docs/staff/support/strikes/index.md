## Overview
From now on, we will use a 3-strike system for staff members.
* Strikes will be given to any staff member that has been determined to have broken a rule.
* Strikes can only be given by members of the Management Team or an Administrator **if permission is specifically granted.**
## Strike counts
* **1 strike:** No action will be taken.
* **2 strikes:** The staff member will be suspended for the length the Management Team deems appropriate.
* **3 strikes:** The Management team will decide if the staff member should be fired or another sort of action should be taken.

:::note

If the rule broken is very severe, **multiple strikes may be given at once.**
