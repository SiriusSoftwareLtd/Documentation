Most of our support tickets are people asking about being whitelisted after purchasing one of our products. Below you can read about how you can handle situations like this.

## Handling a purchase

Whitelisting is handled differently depending on how a user purchased the product. Information on automatic payment methods is listed in <ins>[#upgrade](https://discord.com/channels/939553319750344744/939900864938795068)</ins> and you should be knowledgeable about them. You should not handle any transaction that is meant to be automatic manually unless there was a payment error, in which case you should ping Gigi inside the ticket who will handle the situation accordingly.

Depending on how the user purchased the product, you may have to manually whitelist them. For example, if they purchase a product with ROBUX you will have to manually whitelist them. Doing so is quite easy and intuitive.

Here's how:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="step1" label="Step 1" default>
    After getting the appropriate proof from the user to verify the purchase, run the <code>/whitelist</code> slash command on them. Always add a "note" depending on their tier.
    <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/staff/whitelistcommand.png")} alt="Whitelist Command" style={{marginTop: "1rem"}} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="step2" label="Step 2">
    After running the comand, thank the user for purchasing and log the purchase as shown below.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Logging a purchase

In order to log a purchase that's not logged automatically you have to use the `!logpurchase` command.
You can use this command anywhere, but it's recommended to use it in the ticket channel or in the [#manual-purchase-logs](https://discord.com/channels/939553319750344744/939910602564968538) channel.

For example, to log a Roblox purchase you use the following format:
`!logpurchase <discord ID or mention> <Pro/Essential> <Proof>`

Example:
`;logpurchase @zumo Pro | https://www.roblox.com/users/231536415/profile`

<img src={useBaseUrl("/img/staff/logpurchase-command.png")} alt="Logpurchase Command" style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />
