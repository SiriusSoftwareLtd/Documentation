Automatically handling Stripe and Coinbase purchases was recently introduced. All logs will go to <ins>[#automatic-purchase-logs](https://discord.com/channels/939553319750344744/1053768789650579476)</ins> if you need to verify it.  
You might still need to manually assign the buyer a key if they request it in a ticket with the steps on the previous category.
