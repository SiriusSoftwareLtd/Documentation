As a support member you will encounter people with different issues while attempting to use any script. Most of the issues happen while authenticating and thankfully, it's very easy for support members to see what exactly is going wrong.

The command you will use the most is <code>/get-logs</code>. Which will give you all auth related errors a user had.

## How to use the command:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="step1" label="Step 1" default>
    Run the <code>/get-logs</code> slash command on them.
    <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/staff/logscommand.png")} alt="Logs Command" style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="step2" label="Last Step">
    After running the command, something like this will appear:
    <CodeBlock language="json">
      {`[
  {
    "executed_on": "2023-01-01 00:00:00",
    "type": "Executed",
    "discord_id": "123456789987654321",
    "wl_key": "832bf823y4hf2jfnn823b4f823y4bf",
    "key_status": "Active",
    "assigned_HWID": "283ybf283yfh2n3ehf283u7einj283ufy",
    "exec_HWID": "283ybf283yfh2n3ehf283u7einj283ufy",
    "executor_fingerprint": "syn-fingerprint",
    "game_userid": "",
    "message": "Success"
  }
]`}
    </CodeBlock>
    This will give you pretty much the solution to the problem.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Always check logs when someone gets an error.

You should act by using common sense. For example, if someone's error is a non matching HWID, don't give them a new key and instead reset the HWID.

If the crash/error isn't logged here, it doesn't have to do with the authentication system. Make sure they are using a compatible executor and that Sirius isn't down at the moment (announced in <ins>[#announcements](https://discord.com/channels/939553319750344744/939562142879862914)</ins>, <ins>[#status](https://discord.com/channels/939553319750344744/1077763164474724362)</ins> and <ins>[status.sirius.menu](https://status.sirius.menu)</ins>).
