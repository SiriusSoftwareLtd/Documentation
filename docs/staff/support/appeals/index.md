## Guidelines

1. In order to handle an appeal, you **must either:**
   - Have the "Appeal reviewer" role.
   - Be an administrator.
2. Only the management team can blacklist users from appealing.
3. Appeals can only be handled using Wick
4. The reason of the punishment should be verified by running the _.cases_ command.
5. The staff member who issued the punishment isn't allowed to handle the appeal. Context and information might be given by the staff member who issued the punishment, but the appeal must be handled by someone else. **Management and higher are exempt from this rule.**

## Becoming an appeal reviewer

In order to become an appeal reviewer, you must contact someone in the management team. The following will be taken into account:

- Your activity on the server.
- History of punishments you gave.
- Interactions in the appeals channel.
- Ensure that you are mentally capable of handling appeals, without bias and with a clear mind.

## Second chance policy

The second chance policy is a policy that allows users to appeal almost any punishment after 14 days. The following punishments are not eligible for the second chance policy:

- Doxxing
- Product blacklist
- Intentionally scamming while not being hacked.

This policy is only applied if the punishment was fair and properly issued. If the punishment was not fair or debatable, the user can appeal at any time.

In order for this policy to be applied, the user must apologize for what they did, if they act immature or do not take the appeal seriously, the appeal will be denied and their second chance will be revoked.
